<p align="center">
    Lightweight framework with easily integrated callbacks and easily configurable breakpoint logic that doesn't break between screen sizes.

## Suspendors 1.X

<p>
    The goal of this project was to eliminate common framework issues that anyone who has worked in a framework has inevitably encountered. Issues such as scroll locking or jumping are eliminated when using the integrated cvh and cvw functions and work nearly identically as vh and vw but across practically all devices not just the newer ones. Needing to integrate different logic such as different tools between desktop and mobile platforms are now easily implemented by registering the startup functions with Suspendors and letting it handle the thinking. It is also easy to track orientation with suspendors by utilizing the native support and functions can be registered to trigger with an orientation flip as needed.
