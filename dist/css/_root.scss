// STUB CSS Root Variable Declaration

    // NOTE This is where the root css variables 
    // are declared and defaulted, for example vh100
    // defaults to 100vh if scripts are turned off
    // etc. If variables need to be accessed after 
    // compiling, this is where they need to be
    // declared to ensure no duplicates are made
    // by imports
    
:root{
    --vh100: 100vh;
    --vw100: 100vw;
}
